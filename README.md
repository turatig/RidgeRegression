To run the experiment: python3 RegressionMain.py

To execute unit test of the learning algorithm implementation: python3 Test.py
N.B: some test may sometimes fail for a slightly lower decimal accuracy because points and alpha values are chosen random. In general, should complete successfully.

Ridge Regression implementation: RidgeRegression.py
